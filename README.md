# nextcms
A Next.js CMS combines the flexibility of React with the performance and SEO advantages of server-side rendering and static generation. When deployed on Vercel, it takes full advantage of Vercelâ€™s global edge network, auto-scaling, and CI/CD workflows.

## Getting Started

The Next.js project is located in the `cms` directory. To start the development server:

```bash
cd cms
npm run dev
```

This will launch the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
